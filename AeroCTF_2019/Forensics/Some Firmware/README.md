We have a PLC for automation of technological processes. We downloaded updates for firmware, but something we can not install them. Here is the archive, look, maybe the files are damaged.
Hints:
Completely forgot to say, we use a PLC - PM572. By the way, you can search the original firmware on the ABB website.
