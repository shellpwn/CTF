Opening the file in ghidra and viewing the main.main we see that the input is xored with 0xd and then compared to hardcoded srtring
We then write a simple python programm to print the pass:
  data=[0x89,0x77,0x86,0x87,0xa0,0x8d,0x77,0x85,0x8d,0x85,0xd8,0xa3]
>>> pas=''
>>> for i in range(len(data)):
...     pas=pas+chr((data[i]-0x25)^(0xd))
>>> pass
'i_love_mem\xbes'
Guessing the key we get the key as i_love_memes and here we have our flag :)
