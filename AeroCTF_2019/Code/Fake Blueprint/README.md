We received drawings from our colleagues from another design bureau, but part of the drawings are clearly incorrect. We do not know at what stage the wrong drawings were added, but they are. Revise all the drawings - a very long time, try to find a way to identify the wrong drawings and find everything. If you do this, then great help us.

We were told that LSB is used to mark fake drawings.
