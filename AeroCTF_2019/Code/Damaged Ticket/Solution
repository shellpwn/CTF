Solution
We are given a .7z file and unzipping it gives us random images in parts directory
We first came to know about the count of images by using wc with piping ls output
We notice that each image is md5sum of a number like md5(0).png is one of the images so we decide now to convert those into simple numberical images
for i in {0..599}
do
hash=$(echo -ne "$i" | md5deep)
mv "$hash".png "$i".png
done
This renames ererything from hashes to number easy to understand
Now we need to combine all the images numerically by convert *.png +append out.png
Viewing out.png reviels the flag :)
